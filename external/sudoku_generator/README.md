# Create Sudoku Dataset

You can compile the code using the provided `Makefile` by running:

```bash
make
```

After compilation, you can generate Sudoku data using:

```bash
./sudokuGen numberofdata
```

**Important:** Before running the program, make sure to create the following directories:

```bash
mkdir -p ../../data/puzzles ../../data/solutions
```

I made some changes so that I could create a dataset using this code. This is the real repository:
